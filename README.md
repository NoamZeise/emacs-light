# emacs-light
a small emacs config, uses [nano-emacs](https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs/) theme for a minimalist look

## setup
If you already have emacs, then clone this repo (with submodules) to your home directory and rename to ".emacs.d",
You may need to uncomment a line near the beginning of init.el that disables package check signatures, just for the first time install.
