# emacs-light
A config for GNU Emacs. I call this a 'light' config because I try to keep close to the emacs default controls/shortcuts. 

## features
- C/C++/Rust/Java/lisp/Python IDE
- minimalist theme, modified version of [nano-emacs](https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs/)

## setup
If you already have emacs, then clone this repo (with submodules) to your home directory and rename to ".emacs.d".
You may need to uncomment a line near the beginning of init.el that disables package check signatures, just for the first time install, If you are getting install errors when opening emacs.
